    Welcome to the website of Benjamin Zysberg. As you can notice, it is very "HTML 1.0"-looking. The main reason is that I'm not a designer. I write code and I manage people who code. So instead of trying to make something ugly, I made something functional. It's also really light and energy efficient. All the content displayed in a page (even this one) is stored in the URL. The client (aka you) decodes the URL and generates the DOM. Nothing is stored online. There are no databases or CMS. There is no server-side scripting. It's just a handful of JavaScript files and a simple web server (Express.js on Ubuntu).<BR>
